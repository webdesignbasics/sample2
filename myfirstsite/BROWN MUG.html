	<section><p>	The magic behind the Moka pot is in its 3 chambered brew process. Water in the bottom chamber boils, and the steam causes pressure that pushes water up through the coffee grounds into the top chamber.​

Is the resulting shot the same as an espresso shot? No, not quite.

If you do it right (there is a little skill involved) you’re left with a bittersweet & super-strong concoction that will get you through the day. Heres a guide on brewing moka pot coffee. One bonus to the Moka pot: you can brew multiple cups of coffee (from four to 16) at once. It’s a great way to caffeinate a crowd.</p>

	<section><p><h2>Latte</h2>
As the most popular coffee drink out there, the latte is comprised of a shot of espresso and steamed milk with just a touch of foam. It can be ordered plain or with a flavor shot of anything from vanilla to pumpkin spice. (Here’s how to make a copycat Starbucks pumpkin spice latte.)

	<h2>Cappuccino</h2>
Cappuccino is a latte made with more foam than steamed milk, often with a sprinkle of cocoa powder or cinnamon on top. Sometimes you can find variations that use cream instead of milk or ones that throw in flavor shot, as well.

<h2>Americano</h2>
With a similar flavor to black coffee, the americano consists of an espresso shot diluted in hot water. Pro tip: if you’re making your own, pour the espresso first, then add the hot water.</p>

<h2>Doppio</h2>
A double shot of espresso, the doppio is perfect for putting extra pep in your step.</p>

<h2>Cortado</h2>
 <blockquote>"Like yin and yang, a cortado is the perfect balance of espresso and warm steamed milk. The milk is used to cut back on the espresso’s acidity."</blockquote>

<h2>Red Eye</h2>
Named after those pesky midnight flights, a red eye can cure any tiresome morning. A full cup of hot coffee with an espresso shot mixed in, this will definitely get your heart racing.

<h2>Galão</h2>
Originating in Portugal, this hot coffee drink is closely related to the latte and cappuccino. Only difference is it contains about twice as much foamed milk, making it a lighter drink compared to the other two.
